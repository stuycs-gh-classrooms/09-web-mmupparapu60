      Welcome to the first event! Slalom!
    </h3>
    <p>
      This event is usually the shortest event. The gates are single poles that stand straight up. The gates are close together and the turns are small and fast.
      In this event people wear guards to protect themselves. This is because to ski the course fast you will make contact with the poles. There are also special things called combinations, where the rytham of the course is broken.
      There are four types, hairpin, flush, superflush, and delay.
